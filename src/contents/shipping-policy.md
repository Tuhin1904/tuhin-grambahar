# Shipping Policy

At Gram Bahar, we prioritize delivering a seamless shopping experience to our customers across India. To achieve this, we collaborate with multiple trusted courier partners for our shipping services.

### Shipping Method

Currently, we offer standard shipping as our primary shipping method. While we continuously explore options to expand our shipping services, standard shipping remains the default choice for all orders.

### Delivery Time

The delivery duration may vary based on your location within India. Generally, you can expect your order to be delivered within a range of 2 to 9 days from the date of purchase. Please note that delivery times are approximate and can be subject to factors such as your specific location, courier efficiency, and external circumstances.

### Order Eligibility

We currently accept orders exclusively from within India. While we appreciate the interest of international customers, our shipping services are limited to deliveries within the Indian territory.

### Order Cancellation

Gram Bahar reserves the right to cancel an order within a 48-hour window from the time the order was placed. We understand that situations may arise where order cancellations become necessary. If your order is canceled, we will promptly notify you and provide any relevant information regarding the cancellation.
