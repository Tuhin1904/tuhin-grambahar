# Refund Policy

At Gram Bahar, we aim to provide a hassle-free shopping experience for our valued customers. Our Refund Policy is designed to address various scenarios, ensuring that you receive prompt assistance and resolutions. Please take a moment to review the details below.

### Exchanges and Returns

We understand that sometimes circumstances may lead you to request an exchange or return of a purchased item. To be eligible for an exchange or return, please note the following:

- Your item must be in the same condition as when you received it, unused, and in its original packaging.
- To facilitate the exchange or return process, you are required to provide the invoice at the time of return pickup.
- Once a product has been used, it becomes ineligible for exchange or return.

**Exchanges/Returns are allowed in the following unlikely cases:**

- The product is damaged or you received the wrong item.
- The product's seal was not intact at the time of delivery.
- The product has reached its expiration date upon delivery.

If your return request is accepted, we will arrange a pickup from the same address, and you will be informed of the expected pickup date.

In the case of an exchange, the replacement product will be delivered to you within 3-5 days following the return pickup.

For any discrepancies related to your delivery, please contact us within 48 hours after the order has been marked as delivered.

**Please Note:** If you encounter any quality-related issues, please reach out to us at [grambahar.com@gmail.com](mailto:grambahar.com@gmail.com).

## Cancellation

- Currently, we do not accept cancellation requests from customers.
- If, in exceptional cases, we approve a cancellation request, you will be entitled to a full refund of the entire amount paid.
- Gram Bahar reserves the right to cancel or decline any order for reasons that may include non-availability of stock, pricing errors, incorrect information, or issues with the personal/financial details provided by the customer.

### Refunds

Once we receive and inspect your returned item, we will promptly notify you of its receipt and whether the refund has been approved or not. If your refund is approved, the amount will be automatically credited to your original payment method. Please be aware that it typically takes approximately 5-7 days for the refund to reflect in your account.
